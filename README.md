Predicting Credit Risk for a Banking Institution

Objective:

Credit risk assessment is essential for banks to evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies potential borrowers as either "low risk" or "high risk." This will help the bank make informed lending decisions, mitigate financial losses, and optimize loan portfolio performance.

Problem Statement:

A leading bank is facing challenges in accurately predicting credit risk, resulting in increased loan defaults. To address this, the bank aims to leverage historical customer and loan data to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of default. The data includes various borrower attributes such as credit history, income, loan amount, and repayment behavior. The challenge is to identify the most appropriate model for accurate risk classification.

Success Criteria:

   Train and evaluate four machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost) to predict credit risk.

   Select the model with the best performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a balanced prediction of high-risk and low-risk borrowers.

   Achieve an ROC AUC score of at least 0.85 to ensure the model effectively distinguishes between high-risk and low-risk borrowers.

   Provide actionable insights into the key factors influencing credit risk, enabling the bank to refine its lending strategy and reduce loan defaults..



This model will help the bank enhance its risk assessment capabilities, reduce loan default rates, and improve the profitability of its loan portfolio.
